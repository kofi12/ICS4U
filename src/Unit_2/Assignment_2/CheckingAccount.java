package Unit_2.Assignment_2;

public class CheckingAccount
{
    /* Your CheckingAccount class must inherit from the BankAccount class

       I am also expecting methods to allow for the account to "withdraw" and "deposit"
       Create an interface for these two methods
       Override the toString methods for all classes
       When printing out a CheckingAccount or SavingsAccount the output must look like this

       Example

       Account Number: 4172469835
       Account Holder: Jane Doe
       Balance: $200.50
     */

}
